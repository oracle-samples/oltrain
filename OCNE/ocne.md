### Installation Hands On Labs
Each hands-on lab provides step-by-step procedures to complete specific tasks in an Oracle-provided free lab environment. Follow the procedures to connect to your Oracle Linux compute instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and complete the labs. Alternatively, you can perform the lab steps on your own Oracle Linux environment.

### Kubernetes Videos
An open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications, Kubernetes provides the tools to build a cluster of systems to support the launching of containerized applications. These containers can be deployed across the cluster systems and scaled as needed.

The following videos will introduce you to the Kubernetes cluster technology and its components. They show how a Kubernetes cluster is built, and how container applications in pods are deployed on the cluster nodes.

### Kata Container Videos
Kata Container software delivers the framework for creating lightweight virtual machines (VMs) that easily plug into container ecosystems. Kata Containers offer similar virtual machine levels of security while maintaining the efficiencies gained from the deployment of traditional containers.

The following videos will introduce you to Kata Containers functionality and demonstrate how Kata Containers are deployed in your Kubernetes cluster.

#### Prometheus Video
Operating as an open source monitoring and alerting system. Prometheus uses log collectors for monitoring and performance tuning. Prometheus can gather logs from various metrics and present the data in the form of basic graphs for analysis.

The following video will introduce you to Prometheus, its time-series database and multi-dimensional data model for collecting metrics, as well as describing key steps to installing and running Prometheus.
